A faster and efficient implimentation

### What is new

1. Python - Pandas use in DSSP and PDB parsing.
2. Change in output
3. Similarirty index to comapre different CS.
4. Application

### To do

1. DSSP in pandas [done]
2. PDB in pandas [working on it]
3. Creation of substitution matrix for SSE contacts
4. Run on different redunadant datasets . Maximum coverage.

### suggestion from EBI
1. Provide a way to search for similar and identical protein structures in PDB, provided a query PDB id.
2. Device a similarity measure for contact strings, so that similar topologies could be ranked on that basis
3. It can also be used to a tree analogous to phylogeny, on toplogy basis
4. Export data in JSON format
5. In search result of toplogy by SSE, protein name and id mapping is missing
